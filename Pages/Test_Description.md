# The Conners 3

The *Conners 3* is a multi-informant assessment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and its most common comorbid problems and disorders in children and adolescents between 6 and 18 years of age that takes into account home, social and school settings. The Conners 3 is a reliable and dependable tool capable of supporting the clinical decision making and diagnostic process, the educational eligibility process, intervention planning and monitoring, and for screening purposes. Scores are reported as T-scores with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. The average range is a T-score of 40 to 59.

# T-Score Guidelines

T-Scores: T-Scores are a different type of standardized score; 50 is the average (or mean), and usually 41 to 59 is considered similar to peers. Score greater than 60 are considered "at risk," where scores 70 or above indicate clinically significant problems. T-Scores can be confusing because, depending on what the score is measuring, a high score or a low score could be either “good” or “bad.” For example, a high score on anxiety would not be desirable (suggests the child is experiencing a high degree of anxiety); however, a high score on resiliency would be favorable (suggests the child is highly resilient).

The guidelines in the following table apply to all T-scores presented in this report. Caution: please note that T-score cutoffs are guidelines only and may vary depending on the context of assessment. T-scores from 57-63 should be considered borderline and of special note since the assessor must decide (based on other information and knowledge of the youth) whether or not the concerns in the associated area warrant clinical intervention.

| T-Score | Percentile | Descriptor    |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| 70+     | ≥98        | Very Elevated |
| 65-69   | 93-97      | Elevated      |
| 60-64   | 84-92      | High Average  |
| 40-59   | 16-83      | Average       |
| <40     | <16        | Low           |
